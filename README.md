# Template

## What is it?
A Linux utility to provide boilerplate code for common languages. Handy for quickly firing up some basic syntax and start coding.

## Usage
syntax: template [type] [filename]* [-o]*
(* is optional)
type: html, js, c, java, cpp
filename: output file name (by default it is printed to stdout)
-o: opens the file in gedit

Example: 
`$ template html index.html -o`
